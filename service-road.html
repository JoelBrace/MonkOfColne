            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Road and footpath construction are essential civil engineering services requiring specialized approaches, tailored techniques, and appropriate materials to accommodate their distinct usage demands. We source our materials from industry-leading companies including Tarmac, Cemex, and Holcim, pioneers renowned for their innovation and excellence.</p>
            <p>For roads, construction involves laying multiple layers of robust tarmacadam using machinery, ensuring adequate thickness and durability to withstand heavy vehicle traffic. Typically, roads utilize larger aggregates - around 10mm or 14mm Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) - to provide enhanced strength, resilience, and longevity under significant stress.</p>
            <p>In contrast, footpaths are constructed primarily by hand to allow greater precision and a detailed finish, using smaller aggregate materials and thinner layers, suitable for pedestrian traffic rather than heavy vehicles. This method enables precise control, resulting in smoother, more refined surfaces. Footpaths and roads can also be designed in various colours, enhancing aesthetic appeal.</p>
            <p>At Monk Of Colne, we expertly manage both road and footpath construction, leveraging advanced equipment for roads and meticulous manual craftsmanship for footpaths. Our commitment to quality, safety, and attention to detail ensures that both roads and footpaths are built to the highest standards, delivering long-term functionality and visual appeal.</p>
