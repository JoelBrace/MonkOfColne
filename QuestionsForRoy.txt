What colour scheme would you like?
Do you have a logo to use instead of the one I generated?
What services do you want to advertise? i.e on the carousel (the images rotating below the top navigation) and in more detail, on a specific 'services' page.
Ideally, we need a high resolution image for each service in the carousel that relates to the specific 'service'.
Do you have a different headline you'd like to use? i.e. the bit below the 'Welcome to ...'
Do you have any testimonials from previous clients?
Do you have a Facebook link already?
Pretty sure the previous website was created on WordPress. Do you have contact with the person who created it?
What email does the 'Contact Us' form go to on the current website?
What details from the current website do you want to include in the new one?
Are there any new details you'd like to include in the website that are not in the current one?
Do you have a portfolio of previous jobs, including higher resolution images?
Generally, people like seeing a face to a name so maybe an 'About Us' section that talks about the business and it's history plus its directors. Should help with lead generation.
Are there key features you would like?
Is there a video you'd like on the site?
Are people able to contact by phone instead of the contact form?
Is the main goal of the website lead generation? Showcasing projects?
Who is your target audience? Homeowners? Government? Real estate developers? etc
How often do you imagine updating parts of the website? What parts would need updating? Do you need the ability to update them yourself?
Have you had any existing feedback on the website? Were there any parts people specifically wanted to improve?
